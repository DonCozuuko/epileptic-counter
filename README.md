I got introduced to the fundementals of pygame and to oop. Also this was good practise for structuring programs with classes and calling instances and all that bullshit. Am very new to the world of learning how to learn, but I found it quite the challenge to navigate through the documentation of pygame. Will try to improve on all the above in my next project
